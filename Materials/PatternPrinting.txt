How to Approach the Problem:
1.  In the outer for loop the number of rows = number of lines = that loop will run
2.  Identify for every row number:
a.  how many columns are there
b.  types of element in the column
3.  What do you need to print
4.  Try to find the formula relating rows and columns.
